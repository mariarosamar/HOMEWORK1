# TITLE
SoFi a Finance Company that Can Help You Get Ahead

## Overview and Origin
![Sofi.png]
SoFi is short for Social Finance – offers student loan refinancing, personal loans and mortgages to young borrowers with high-end jobs and degrees. SoFi is a FinTech unicorn with valuation of over $4 billions.

The company was incorporated in August 2011.
The founders of the company are: Mike Cagney, James Finnigan, Ian Brady, Dan Macklin. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education.

The company’s inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested an average of $20,000 to 100 students.
    In September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million, led by Baseline Ventures, with participation from DCM and Renren. Additional investors included Ron Suber.
    On October 2, 2013, SoFi announced that it had raised $500 million in debt and equity to fund and refinance student loans. This total funding amount came from $90 million in equity, $151 million in debt, and $200 million in bank participations, with the remaining capital from alumni and community investors. The $151 million in debt includes a $60 million line of credit from Morgan Stanley, and a $41 million line of credit from Bancorp.
    In April 2014, SoFi raised $80 million in a Series C round led by Discovery Capital Management with participation from Peter Thiel, Wicklow Capital, and existing investors. Money was raised to expand the footprint of the company's student loan refinancing business and to extend into new products like mortgages and personal loans.

According to empirica the best lending companies , where SoFi is included, include primarily peer-to-peer lending platforms as well as underwriter and lending platforms using machine learning technologies and algorithms to assess creditworthiness. Also new leasing solutions are also classified in a lending space.

## Business Activities:

* Financial Problem

 SoFi is still trying to balance its rapid growth with something that's a little more responsible and a little more focused on being a viable and successful business longer term, said Robert Wildhack, an analyst at Autonomous Research. 
 The second problem is that SoFi receives a high volume of complaints.  (Consistent with BBB policy, effective 1/1/2018, BBB is publishing the details of 25% of this business’ complaints online. All complaints are counted in the total number of complaints)


*Costumers

 They are young borrowers with high-end jobs and degrees. SoFi offers student loan refinancing, personal loans and mortgages.

To hold its costumers the company, which initially offered student loan refinancing for high-earning top-tier graduates and has since expanded its offerings, differentiates with VIP-style “member” benefits. These include access to events, dinners, career coaching and other perks. While opening up membership to a wider customer base has cost implications, it’s part of a longer-term strategy to build lifetime value for a loyal customer base that’s excited enough about the brand to take up other products.

Bigger plan extend its costumers and products. SoFi’s foray into bank accounts, for US citizens and residents, going beyond lending to become a “personal finance operating system” for customers annoyed with high fees and clunky digital interfaces, Meron Colbeci, SoFi’s svp of product management, said when the company first announced its banking product plans. CEO Anthony Noto recently outlined a product roadmap that goes much farther than loans, including building out its wealth management product, a digital and physical advice platform, brokerage and crypto. Credit cards are also in SoFi’s plans, with Bloomberg reporting Monday that the company hired an ex-Citi executive to help build a branded credit card.
SoFi could soon let members buy individual stocks and cryptocurrencies through its wealth management platform

As an idea about its market SoFi is a FinTech unicorn with valuation of over $4 billion.


Advantage and unfair advantage

SoFi offers these solutions at an advantage in relation to its compettitors:

    No fees or hidden fees, low rates.
    Career services to theirs members.

SoFi is far from the only marketplace lender to create plans to enter new markets. Other online lenders such as Lending Club are also making widening available loans to markets across different segments such as home improvement, mortgages, student and personal loans.
In Elsewhere, Prosper Marketplace, a P2P lender focusing on the consumer loan market, acquired personal finance app.
In addition, after focusing on the small and medium-sized business (SMB) loan market, Kabbage launched a consumer loan brand called Karrot 2014, and is now expanding beyond just direct loans as they added white label partnership solutions this year. 
But SoFi is making a clear statement that they believe digital financial services has plenty of room to grow, and won’t only be limited to the lending market.

The unfair disadvantage is that SoFi misrepresented the saving on its refinancing student loans. According to an FTC press release, the government agency has approved a final consent order with SoFi that resolves it of allegations that it misrepresented how much student loan borrowers saved by refinancing with the online lender or how much they could save working with the company.

## Landscape:

* SoFi is in the lending domain of the financial industry, but they are not limited to it. They are going also to Leasing solutions.

* Major trends and innovations of the domain:
Mobile Banking that is able to deposit checks—transfer funds—apply for loans!—all from our mobile devices. Mobile banking is truly an environment where company with the easiest app wins.
Mobile pay becomes a “normal” part of retail
Movil apps provided by third-party financial service providers
Blockchain proves to be a huge asset in digital payments, escrow services, loan processing, and just about every other area where valuable information or currency needs the utmost security.
Automated Wealth Managers smart (automated) wealth managers—er, wealth bots. Using complex algorithms, AI-driven bots can calculate the best investment opportunities, the best interest rates, the best loan providers—pretty much everything someone needs to stay on top of their investment prospects.
Big Data needs to have the machine learning tools to process it quickly and accurately in ways that allow them to better serve customers, save money, save time—or make money more efficiently.

This domain is preparing for the Future of Account Opening, driving organizations to move to the cloud, DevOps and innovation thinking on consumer satisfaction.

## Results

* The business impact of this company so far is positive. At its launch in 2011, SoFi focused on refinancing student loans. Soon added personal loans and mortgages to the mix, the growth fueled by his fundraising prowess and excellent timing. Before long valued in 4 billions, and managing a multi-billion dollar loan book give us the best idea about its positive results.

* The Metrics
Lending companies are using metrics to measure the complete story about your customers, your business and the market. Going deep, metrics should measure how your app or your product is functioning, how your marketing efforts are performing and the end business results help to figure out how your business is going.
They are typically using seven metrics (KPI)
Acquisition Metrics: 
This indicates how many new customers you’re managing to onboard. That means measuring KPIs such as app downloads and new user creation rate.
Activation Metrics: 
This metric tells how you’re doing at getting people to use your product. Useful KPIs include Monthly Active Users (MAUs) and app/site traffic.
Retention Metrics:
Measure your success at keeping people engaged with your product - particularly vital if your business is subscription-based. So, KPIs such as active accounts, inactive accounts and returning customers.
Referrals 
Willingness to recommend your product to others is the best possible feedback your customers can give you, and strong performance in this area will do wonders for business growth. Focus on KPIs such as social shares.
Revenues 
This is pretty self-explanatory, but ultimately it’s the most important factor. Look at KPIs such as daily revenue and number of transactions to get a nuanced picture of performance.
Marketing Metrics 
This is a huge area to distill in one point, but figuring out which of your efforts to attract customers is working is crucial, especially as your business grows and your costs magnify.  Important KPIs here include conversion rates, web traffic sources, cost per lead and customer lifetime value. 
Technical Metrics 
Often overlooked, technical metrics are crucial for any SaaS or app-based company, especially in fintech where users need to trust you with their (and their own client’s) money. Keep an eye on page load times, rates of timeouts, number of simultaneous connections, and percentage of database memory used to make sure your delivery stays smooth and frictionless.

The visible metrics founded about SoFi are on referrals where 75% of its costumers show their satisfaction. The other 25%, BBB shows on detail the complaints of the costumers.


SoFi's performing is positive, Forbes and empirica includes SoFi among the top lending companies. 

## Recommendations

* SoFi would have products that use blockchain. One biggest advantage of it is having cash in very short time without waiting one or two days. The founder that left SoFi said his new company will have products supported by blockchain.
The company would benefit of the products using blockchain because those products are first need of costumers. Complains come from this mising need. I think that SoFi would be one of the first lending companies releasing cash closer to real time.


 Follow the trend in technology of lending domain such ast preparing for the Future of Account Opening, driving organizations to move to the cloud, DevOps and innovation thinking all the time on consumer satisfaction.

* The other recommendation is that SoFi should be attach to its big plan, working on getting a balance after its successful startup and fast growing.
